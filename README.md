# WhatsApp-For-Linux

**WhatsApp-For-Linux** is an unofficial installer and wrapper that brings WhatsApp Web (https://web.whatsapp.com) to the Linux desktop as a native application. It uses Nativefier (https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) (Electron) to package WhatsApp Web into a desktop app that runs on all major Linux distributions.  

This project is developed and maintained by spontaneocus (Martin J. Keatings) and is not affiliated with or endorsed by WhatsApp Inc. In short, it provides the convenience of a dedicated WhatsApp desktop client for Linux, without needing to keep a browser open.

## üöÄ Features and Compatibility

- Native Desktop Experience: Runs as a standalone application with its own window and icon ‚Äì no web browser needed.  
- Full WhatsApp Web Functionality: Access chats, groups, voice messages, file sharing, and Status updates (note: voice/video calls are not supported as they are not part of WhatsApp Web).  
- Desktop Notifications: Get real-time notifications through your system‚Äôs notification service.  
- System Integration: Adds a desktop launcher (.desktop file) and supports autostart at login.  
- Cross-Distribution Support: Works with Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, Arch/Manjaro, openSUSE, Alpine, Gentoo, and more.  
- Always Up to Date: Uses the live WhatsApp Web, so the interface updates automatically as WhatsApp updates their web app.  
- Headless/Server Mode: Can run on servers without displays using Xvfb (https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml).

## üñ•Ô∏è What is Nativefier?

Nativefier (https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) is a command-line tool that turns any website into a desktop application using Electron (https://www.electronjs.org/).  

Why use this instead of just a browser shortcut?

- Dedicated App Window: No address bar, no browser clutter ‚Äì just WhatsApp.  
- Persistent Login: Keeps your QR-code login session even if you clear your browser cache.  
- Desktop Integration: Appears in your application menu, has its own icon, and uses native notifications.  
- Controlled Updates: The Electron engine can be updated independently of your system browser.  

In short: it feels like a native app while being just WhatsApp Web under the hood.

## üñß Headless Server Usage

You can run WhatsApp-For-Linux without a GUI using Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer).  

Example with xvfb-run:
xvfb-run -a whatsapp-for-linux

Or create a systemd service at /etc/systemd/system/whatsapp.service:
```
[Unit]
Description=WhatsApp for Linux (headless)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yourusername
Environment=DISPLAY=:99
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/whatsapp-for-linux
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Note: You must perform the initial QR code login in a GUI environment (or by viewing the Xvfb display with VNC/screenshot) before running headless.
