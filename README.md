# Whatsapp-For-Linux

This is an experimental script and has been tested only on a few environments. The hope is to refine it to work with all linux variations so if you encounter an error on a different environment please raise an issue on github and I can push a revised code for your version of linux.

# What does this script do?

It is pretty simple:

1. It uses the web version of whatsapp.
2. It wraps it in its own wrapper so it looks and feels as if it is whatsapp running locally.
3. It installs all pre-requisites and dependencies for whatsapp to work.
4. It creates an icon in you applications menu.
5. It sets the wrapper to launch on startup.
6. It works on most linux variations.
